# Multi-tenant Application Demo
This demo is to showcase how a multi-tenant app registration from Tenant A can provision a service principal identity and secret into Tenant B. This is done with the following Microsoft technologies: A multi-tenanted application registration, a serivce principal identity and client secret, a key vault.

For demoing purposes i will also create a storage account in Tenant A to showcase the new credential beind used. This demo is to demonstrate a multi-tenant capability where Tenant A creates and controlls a service principal identity to Tenant B, and places least priviledge RBAC on that identity so Tenant B can access limited technologies in Tenant A.

The Setup Looks like the following:
1.) set up multi-tenant app to create a service principal
	a.) Choose a redirect URI
2.) Set up a client secret
	a.) go to the multi-tenant application and create a client secret
3.) Set up the service principal RBAC for the provider storage account
4.)	Provision the new identity in the customer tenant with crafted login
5.) assign RBAC to the new identity to talk to a KV in the customer tenant
6.) Provider sends over the client secret to the customer in a call to the customers keyvault
7.) the customer then can craft a call to the providers storage account


## Process

### Tenant A
1. set up multi-tenant app to create a service principal
	1. When creating a multi-teant application that will be provisioned in another tenant, please select one of the following options:
		1. Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) *this is the best option to select if Tenant B is another Entra ID tenant.*
		1. Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox) *this is best to use if the other tenant is a personal accout.*
		1. include the redirect URI to be https://entra.microsoft.com if you do not have a redirect url on hand.
1. Set up a client secret for that multi-tenant application under the "Certificates & secrets" blade.
1. Update the clientID in the following URL and send Tenant B the link to provision the service principal into their Entra ID tenant: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&response_mode=query&scope=openid&client_id=your_client_ID`
1. Set up the Stroage account, with a container, and place a test blob in the container. (this is not created in this sample code) *Best RBAC for this scenario: Storage Blob Data Contributor*
1. Setup service principal RBAC for the provider storage account.
1. Eventually once Tenant B provides Tenant A with a Keyvault URI, we can look at keyvault-demo code to showcase how to send over the client secret in code.

### Tenant B

1. Provision the new identity in the customer tenant with crafted login be clicking on the link above.
1. Create a Key Vault where the customer can share the service principal identity.
1. Assign RBAC to the new identity to talk to a KV in the customer tenant. *Note Key Vault Secrets Officer is a great option for users writing secrets to another key vault*
1. Inform Tenant A to send over the clientsecret by providing them a Keyvault URI.
1. Once the client secret is retrieved, Tenant B then can craft a call to the providers storage account, we can look at storage-demo to showcase how to use the provided credentials to look at Tenant A's blob.
